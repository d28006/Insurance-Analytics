1. Project Title / Headline
🛡 Insurance Analytics Dashboard: Policyholder Demographics, Risk Profiles & Claims Insights

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze insurance policyholder demographics, vehicle usage, and claim distributions across multiple customer attributes—empowering insurance companies to optimize risk assessment, pricing, and claims management.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The Insurance Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of policyholder and claim-related data across various demographic and behavioral dimensions. It enables insurance managers, underwriters, and actuaries to monitor claims by gender, age, income, marital status, education level, vehicle usage, and coverage type. The dashboard highlights risk trends, identifies high-claim segments, and supports data-driven decision-making for underwriting, customer segmentation, and product design.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for visual storytelling and reporting

🔄 Power Query (M) – Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation of insurance datasets

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculating measures like claim frequency, percentage shares, and demographic breakdowns

🧩 Data Modeling – Creating relationships between policyholder details, claim information, and demographic dimensions

🗄 SQL Server / Excel (depending on source) – Initial dataset preparation before loading into Power BI

📁 File Format – .pbix project with exported dashboard images for sharing

4. Data Source

Source: Public insurance dataset containing customer and policy details.

The dataset includes:

Policyholder demographics – Gender, Age, Marital Status, Income, Education

Vehicle & usage attributes – Car type, car use (private/commercial), and zones

Insurance coverage details – Policy type, premium, and claim history

Claims data – Frequency, distribution across categories, and claim ratios

5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem

Insurance providers face challenges in understanding which customer groups pose higher claim risks, how demographics influence claims, and which policy structures drive profitability. Without visibility, pricing and underwriting decisions may lead to losses.

• Goal of the Dashboard

To empower insurers with:

A consolidated view of claims distribution across demographics

Insights into riskier policyholder groups (e.g., age, gender, income brackets)

Ability to compare claim trends by coverage type, vehicle use, and region

Data-driven guidance for premium pricing, customer targeting, and risk control

6. Walkthrough of Key Visuals

Top KPIs Panel – Displays total claims, policy count, and average claim rate.

Claims by Gender (Pie/Donut Chart) – Distribution of claims across male vs female policyholders.

Claims by Age Group (Bar Chart) – Identifies higher claim frequencies among certain age brackets.

Income vs Claims (Column/Stacked Chart) – Highlights claim rates across income categories, linking affordability with risk.

Marital Status & Education Claims (Categorical Comparison) – Analyzes how lifestyle and education levels correlate with claims.

Car Use & Coverage Type (Segmented Analysis) – Differentiates private vs commercial vehicle claims and high- vs low-coverage claims.

Zone-based Claims (Map or Categorical Chart) – Tracks claim patterns geographically or across designated risk zones.

7. Business Impact & Insights

📊 Demographic Risk Profiles: Certain age groups and income levels are associated with higher claim frequencies, guiding underwriting rules.

🚗 Car Usage Risk: Commercial vehicle use shows a higher claim ratio, impacting pricing models.

👫 Marital & Gender Trends: Marital status and gender differences highlight lifestyle-related risk factors.

🌍 Geographical Exposure: Zone-based segmentation supports regional claim forecasting and resource allocation.

💲 Pricing Optimization: Insights enable insurers to adjust premiums dynamically by demographic and coverage risk level.

🎯 Strategic Planning: Helps actuaries and managers refine underwriting, reduce loss ratios, and improve portfolio profitability.)
